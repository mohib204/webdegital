        <p>My name is Rich. I was born in Ohio on April 30th, 1982. I went to elementary school until 6th grade, then to middle school for 2 years, and high school for a year and a half. After that, I transferred to a high school in Lima, Ohio, for the rest of that year. Then I attended the School for the Blind in Columbus for 2 years and graduated with a diploma. I am visually impaired due to a condition called toxoplasmosis, which affects my ability to see far.</p>
        <p>I have brown hair and eyes and I am 6 foot 1 inch tall.</p>
        <p>I enjoy using my Roku and Fire TV Stick to watch Pluto TV.</p>
